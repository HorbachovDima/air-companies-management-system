Dear user, to use this app, you need to clone this repository, then create the database using the SQL file in the data folder, then get into the project folder and run docker using the command docker-compose up --build. If the app started successfully it is possible to check endpoints using Postman. To stop all services use the command - docker-compose down.

:exclamation:In the Postman collection, there is a possibility to find documentation for the endpoints.
