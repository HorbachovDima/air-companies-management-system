Dear user, to use this app, you need to clone this repository, then create the database using the SQL file in the data folder, also important thing is to package the project using maven to create a jar file(use Java 8), then get into the project folder and run docker using the command docker-compose up --build. If the app started successfully it is possible to check endpoints using Postman. To stop all services use the command docker-compose down.

:exclamation:Documentation for the endpoints can be found in the Postman collection.
